<h1>Titanic Survivors</h1>
The Titanic Survivors project is a binary classification problem in which a Logistic Regression model is trained on a dataset of Titanic passengers to predict their survival outcomes based on a set of features that include age, gender, and ticket class.

<h3>Technologies Used </h3>
This project was developed using the Python programming language, along with several data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The model was trained using a Logistic Regression algorithm, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to identify the optimal set of parameters for the model.

 <h3>Features  </h3>
This project offers a predictive model that can accurately predict the survival outcomes of Titanic passengers based on their age, gender, and ticket class. This model can be used to gain insights into the factors that played a crucial role in determining who survived the disaster.

 <h3>System Requirements </h3>
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system, along with the following data science libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook, which can be run on any system that supports Jupyter Notebook.

 <h3>Installation and Running </h3>
To install and run the project, you can clone the GitHub repository, install the required libraries using pip, and run the code in the Jupyter Notebook to train the model on the Titanic dataset. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data.

 <h3>Known Issues/Bugs  </h3>
